## About Me
I am a high school student in Japan, who had been in Wisconsin for a year as an exchange student before. My current enthusiasm is researching decentralized identity management (a.k.a Self Sovereign Identity), which also had me into blockchain and P2P Network.

Although I spend a lot of time reading documents and papers, I also love to code for my own web applications. I have been working on [a data transfer app using WebRTC](https://github.com/kota-yata/instant-drop) for this two months, as well as maintaining and optimizing this blog. Despite the trend in these days that people love to use React and Vue, I consider myself as a Svelte enthusiast. The biggest reason behind me using Svelte is just that I started using it earlier than any other frameworks simply out of curiosity, but I also love how quick its build is and how intuitive to write.
